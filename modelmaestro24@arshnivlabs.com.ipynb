    "In retail, predicting the likelihood that a customer will complete a purchase is crucial for optimizing sales strategies, managing inventory, and personalizing customer experiences. Given a dataset of product sales, customer demographics, and promotional campaigns, the task is to predict whether a transaction will result in a completed purchase (binary outcome: Yes/No). The goal is to develop classification models that estimate the probability of a customer completing their order based on various features, such as product pricing, customer demographics, and promotional offers. \n",

    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop various classification models that predict the likelihood of a purchase being completed, given the customer and product features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to predict the likelihood that a transaction will result in a completed purchase based on features such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer ID: A unique identifier for each customer. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Age: The customer's age, which could influence buying patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Gender: The gender of the customer (Male/Female). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Loyalty Member: Whether the customer is a member of the loyalty program (Yes/No), which could indicate higher engagement or likelihood to complete a purchase. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Product Type: The category or type of product purchased (e.g., Electronics, Apparel), which might correlate with purchase completion rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "- SKU: Unique identifier for the product (Stock Keeping Unit). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Rating: The average product rating (1-5), which could influence the customer's decision to complete the purchase. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Order Status: Indicates whether the order was completed, pending, or canceled. For this model, the target will be whether the order was completed (Yes/No). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Payment Method: The method of payment used (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal), which may influence the probability of a transaction being completed. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Unit Price: The price per unit of the product, as higher-priced items may have lower conversion rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Quantity: The number of units purchased in the order. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Purchase Date: The date when the purchase was made, which might capture time-related patterns in purchase behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Shipping Type: The shipping method chosen by the customer (e.g., Standard, Expedited), which could be linked to the likelihood of completing the order. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Add-ons Purchased: Whether the customer bought additional items (e.g., accessories, warranties) along with the main product (Yes/No). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Add-on Total: The total cost of any add-ons purchased, which contributes to the final price and may influence purchase completion. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The goal is to predict the probability that a customer will complete a transaction, which will be modelled as a binary outcome:** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Preprocessing: \n",
    "\n",
    "Clean the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and ensuring that only completed orders are used in the target variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a binary target variable: 1 for completed orders, 0 for non-completed orders. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature Engineering: \n",
    "\n",
    "Engineer features from the raw data, such as creating binary variables for Add-ons Purchased or Loyalty Member status. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normalize or scale continuous features like Unit Price and Quantity if necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Training: \n",
    "\n",
    "Split the dataset into training and testing sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Train the classification models on the training data to predict the binary outcome of purchase completion. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Evaluation: \n",
    "\n",
    "Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to evaluate model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Prediction: \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the trained classification models to predict the likelihood of purchase completion for future transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Conclusion:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the best model based on efficiency in solving the business problem##"
